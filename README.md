# cascade-bridge-adapter-clinvar

The **Cascade Bridge Adapter** for ClinVar VCV XML: the package of data a
**Cascade Bridge** runs to turn NCBI ClinVar variation records into Cascade
RDF. The pilot adapter: import-only, a published NCBI schema, no vendor quirks,
an existing converter of about 2,200 lines in cascade-cli to re-express as data,
and four conformance oracles already written.

The contract it is written against is the
[Cascade Bridge Specification](https://github.com/jayostis/cascade-bridge-spec),
at the revision the crate pins. That repository is the authority.

There is no code here and there will be none. An adapter is mappings, schemas,
fixtures and a manifest; the thing that runs it is a Bridge. Nothing in this
repository executes.

It is written against a **pinned revision of the Cascade Bridge Specification**,
[cascade-bridge-spec](https://github.com/jayostis/cascade-bridge-spec), named by
`bridge:specPin` in the crate, and it validates itself against that revision in
its own CI. The specification does not know this adapter exists; the arrow runs
this way and only this way.

## Status

**Phase 1, version 0.2.0: the adapter laid out, and checked against the
specification it pins.** Manifest, pinned schema, fixtures with recorded
provenance, references to the large datasets, editor configuration, and a
workflow that calls the specification's published lint. No mapping, no runner.

| phase | what | where | done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | this layout | here ([#1](https://github.com/jayostis/cascade-bridge-adapter-clinvar/issues/1)) | it opens in VS Code with everything validating |
| 2 | the first mapping (XSLT 3, one module per record class) and the engine that runs it | here and `bridge-engine-java` (Camel YAML route, Saxon-HE, riot) | the four committed cases compare isomorphic |
| 3 | the same mapping as SPARQL CONSTRUCT over the Bridge's XML lift | `in/sparql/` | the two graphs are diffed and the difference reported |
| 4 | the same adapter, byte for byte, through JavaScript engines | `bridge-engine-browser` | the same `manifest.ttl` passes in both |

## How a Bridge runs it

1. Reads `ro-crate-metadata.json`, the adapter's manifest and its provenance
   record in one RO-Crate. The root entity is the adapter: format id
   `clinvar`, the two envelopes (`#envelope-efetch`, `#envelope-release`),
   the unit `VariationArchive`, the detect rule, the `xslt-3` profile it
   must offer, the vocabulary pin, and the test manifest, every one of them
   a link to an entity in the same graph.
2. Routes an input here when the crate's detect rule, one XPath 3.1 boolean, is
   true of it: an efetch envelope holding records, the empty `set` efetch
   returns when a query matched none, or a release envelope. The expression is in
   the crate; `docs/format.md` has which roots were deliberately not claimed.
3. Splits the document on `VariationArchive` and validates each unit against
   `schema/ClinVar_VCV_2.6.xsd`. A unit that fails is a finding; it still goes
   through.
4. Runs the mapping (phase 2) on each unit, links the interpretation and
   submitter-assertion records to their Variant, stamps provenance, checks
   every predicate against the pinned vocabularies, validates with SHACL,
   and hands the graph and findings to the runtime.
5. In test, executes `fixtures/manifest.ttl`. Each entry's type carries how it
   is judged, and the rule is the `rdfs:comment` on that type in the
   specification's vocabulary, not anything this repository states.

Those stages are the Bridge's, not this adapter's; the specification's
[`docs/stages.md`](https://github.com/jayostis/cascade-bridge-spec/blob/v0.2.0/docs/stages.md)
names each with its Enterprise Integration Pattern. `docs/format.md` describes
the format the first three stages see.

The four directories marked phase 2 or 3 do not exist yet; they are named
here so the shape is visible. Phase 2 adds them to the crate: the XSLT as
the crate's `mainEntity` (Workflow RO-Crate), the tables as `bridge:table`,
the extension vocabulary as `bridge:extensionVocabulary`.

## Decisions

The decisions that shaped this adapter — the manifest being an RO-Crate rather
than an `adapter.yaml`, the cases being a W3C `mf:` test manifest, the
detect rule being one XPath expression, standards over inventions — are not
restated here. Each is a property of the **adapter package format**, and the
authority for that format is the Cascade Bridge Specification:
[`docs/adapter-manifest.md`](https://github.com/jayostis/cascade-bridge-spec/blob/v0.2.0/docs/adapter-manifest.md),
[`docs/test-manifest.md`](https://github.com/jayostis/cascade-bridge-spec/blob/v0.2.0/docs/test-manifest.md)
and [`docs/alignment.md`](https://github.com/jayostis/cascade-bridge-spec/blob/v0.2.0/docs/alignment.md).

What is specific to ClinVar rather than to adapters in general is in
[`docs/format.md`](docs/format.md): why the schema pin is 2.6, why an envelope
wrapper schema exists, and what is and is not known about the committed inputs.
Why this adapter is laid out the way it is, and the phases, are in
[issue #1](https://github.com/jayostis/cascade-bridge-adapter-clinvar/issues/1).

Naming is the one decision still open: how a record's IRI is minted is decided
in phase 2.

## Verification

This package must conform to the Cascade Bridge Specification at the revision
its crate pins. `.github/workflows/validate.yml` calls that specification's
published lint at the matching tag on every pull request; what it checks, and
what a failure means, is
[`docs/validation.md`](https://github.com/jayostis/cascade-bridge-spec/blob/v0.2.0/docs/validation.md)
there. Failures come out of the build.

A few things a lint cannot see — that a file exists on disk, that an input
validates against its schema, that the oracle copies are byte-identical to
conformance — are run by hand before pushing; `fixtures/CLAUDE.md` and
`schema/CLAUDE.md` say how.

There is no test suite here by design. Executing an adapter's fixtures is a
Bridge's job, and no Bridge exists yet: phase 2 is when this adapter is proven
rather than described.

## Licence

Apache-2.0 for the package. ClinVar data is NCBI's, under
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/home/about/policies/; each committed NCBI-derived
file's entry in `ro-crate-metadata.json` says so.
